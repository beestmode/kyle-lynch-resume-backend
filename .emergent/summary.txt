<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built an interactive resume application following an old fashioned parchment paper design. The development proceeded chronologically, starting with frontend mock data, then integrating backend services. Key features like CMS-style editing, contact forms, and PDF generation were implemented. The user provided resume content and specific updates, which the AI incorporated. The primary challenge has been the deployment of the FastAPI backend to Railway. The process involved manually uploading files to GitHub, configuring environment variables, and iterative debugging of build and runtime crashes, demonstrating the agent's persistence in resolving deployment issues. The current state is that the backend repeatedly crashes on access, and the AI is actively requesting the latest crash logs for diagnosis.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an interactive resume application with an old fashioned parchment paper design. Key features include:
- An interactive, visually appealing frontend.
- Integration of LinkedIn profile (initially accepted as fine, then a specific URL was provided).
- CMS-style editing for resume content, allowing updates to experience, education, skills, and personal information.
- A functional contact form for potential employers to submit messages.
- Ability to generate and download a PDF version of the resume.
- Backend system to manage content and form submissions.
- Specific content updates for Kyle Lynch: change email to , refactor experience to focus on Facilities Coordinator and Customer Liaison roles, update current position to Carlton Staffing, Sugar Land, TX (7/25-present), and re-add Victory Driveaway (2/23-7/25).
- Deployment of the full-stack application for public access, specifically using DreamHost for frontend, Railway for backend, MongoDB Atlas for the database, and the domain .

**Key Files and their importance/changes:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores mock data for the frontend development, allowing the UI to be built and tested independently before backend integration.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created with basic resume data, then updated multiple times to reflect user-requested changes (email, job titles, experience descriptions, employment history).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application component, responsible for routing and initial API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate  for navigation, initially made a  call, and later refactored to use backend APIs via .
-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS and application-specific styling.  sets up TailwindCSS and global variables,  contains custom styles.
    -   **Changes**: Significant additions to  to implement the old-fashioned parchment design, including background images, textures, fonts (e.g., calligraphic), and color schemes, as well as modifications to  for custom fonts and background colors.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines API contracts between frontend and backend, lists mocked data, and outlines backend implementation strategy.
    -   **Changes**: Created to detail API endpoints, data models, and integration plan.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application, defines API routes, handles middleware, and orchestrates calls to database and authentication modules.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a basic Hello World endpoint, then expanded significantly to include CRUD operations for resume components (personal info, highlights, skills, experience, education), contact form submission, PDF generation, and admin authentication endpoints. Imports were fixed ( libraries) during debugging.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Pydantic models defining the structure of data for requests and responses, ensuring data validation and serialization.
    -   **Changes**: Created to define , , , , , , and  models, along with their  and  variants.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles all interactions with the MongoDB database, abstracting connection and CRUD operations for different collections.
    -   **Changes**: Created to manage , , , including methods for getting/updating resume data, saving contact messages, and managing users. An  for  model was fixed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Implements JWT-based authentication for admin users, including password hashing, token creation, and dependency injection for protected routes.
    -   **Changes**: Created to provide , , , , , , and  functions.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains logic for generating a PDF version of the resume using , styled with parchment-like aesthetics.
    -   **Changes**: Created to include  class with methods for custom styles, building various resume sections, and adding a parchment background.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides initial mock resume data for database seeding.
    -   **Changes**: Created with a comprehensive  dictionary mirroring the user's resume content, used for  in .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Updated multiple times during deployment debugging to include missing packages like , , , , .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Informs cloud platforms like Railway how to start the web service.
    -   **Changes**: Created with the command  to correctly launch the FastAPI application.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralized service for making API calls to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Created to encapsulate Axios calls to the various backend endpoints, replacing mock data usage in frontend components.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend component for submitting contact messages.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to interact with the backend  endpoint instead of handling data locally.
-   ** (and similar admin components)**:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend components allowing admin users to edit resume content.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to send data to the backend CRUD endpoints (e.g., ).

<pending_tasks>
- The primary pending task is to **diagnose and fix the recurring crash of the FastAPI backend on Railway** when the  endpoint is accessed.
- The frontend still needs to be built and uploaded to DreamHost, and then configured to connect to the deployed Railway backend.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in debugging the deployment of the FastAPI backend to Railway. The application successfully deployed once, but then crashed when the user attempted to access the  endpoint. This led to a cycle of diagnosis and attempted fixes.

**Key events and state:**
- The backend code, including all models, database logic, authentication, PDF generation, and API endpoints, has been uploaded to the user's GitHub repository.
- A  was added to instruct Railway how to start the  server, fixing a previous No start command found error.
- Environment variables (, , , ) were correctly configured in Railway.
- An  in  was identified and a fix was applied to remove the erroneous import.
- Despite these fixes, the backend continues to crash upon access to the  endpoint. The AI suspects a runtime error that occurs specifically when the application attempts to handle an incoming request.
- The user has provided recent logs (), which the AI needs to analyze to pinpoint the new crash cause. The current state is that the backend service on Railway is in a crashed or restarting loop, preventing it from being accessible.

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the latest crash logs provided by the user to identify the root cause of the backend failure and propose a specific fix.
