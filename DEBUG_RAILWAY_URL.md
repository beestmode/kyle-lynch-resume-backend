# 🔍 Debug Railway "Not Found" Issue

## Progress: ✅ No Crash = SSL Fix Worked!
The MongoDB SSL connection is now working since there's no crash.

## Issue: "Not Found" = Routing Problem
Let's test different URL patterns to find the correct endpoint.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Find Your Exact Railway URL
In Railway dashboard:
- Go to your service
- Look for the **public URL** (might be in Settings > Domains)
- Copy the full URL (like `https://something.railway.app`)

### 2. Test Different Endpoints
Try these URLs in your browser:

```
https://your-railway-url.railway.app
https://your-railway-url.railway.app/
https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api
https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/
```

### 3. Check Railway Logs
In Railway:
- Go to your service
- Click **"Deployments"** tab  
- Click on the latest deployment
- Check the **build logs** and **deploy logs**
- Look for any errors or port configuration issues

### 4. Verify Port Configuration
Make sure in Railway Settings > Variables:
```
PORT=8001
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong Base URL
❌ If all URLs return 404, the service might not be running properly
✅ Check deployment logs for startup errors

### Issue 2: Missing /api Routes  
❌ If base URL works but `/api/` doesn't, there's a routing issue
✅ Our FastAPI should handle both `/` and `/api/` routes

### Issue 3: Port Mismatch
❌ Railway might expect a different port
✅ Try setting `PORT` environment variable to Railway's expected port

### Issue 4: Build Issues
❌ Code might not have deployed properly
✅ Check if all files uploaded correctly

## Expected Results
When working, you should see:
- `https://url.railway.app/api/` → `{"message":"Kyle Lynch Resume API is running","status":"healthy"}`
- Or it might be on the root: `https://url.railway.app/` → same JSON response

## Debug Commands
If you have access to Railway CLI:
```bash
railway logs
railway status
```
