# COMPLETE DREAMHOST UPLOAD GUIDE

## 🎯 ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED
The problem was the "Made with Emergent" badge and tracking scripts in the HTML file.

## 📋 UPLOAD THESE EXACT FILES TO DREAMHOST:

### 1. ROOT LEVEL (kylelynch.site/)
- `index.html` (CLEAN - no Emergent badge)
- `asset-manifest.json`

### 2. static/css/ folder
- `main.ef3f9dc3.css`

### 3. static/js/ folder  
- `main.08e1dd48.js` (360,505 bytes)

## 🔧 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

✅ index.html has correct title: "Kyle Lynch - Resume"
✅ index.html references: "/static/js/main.08e1dd48.js"
✅ index.html has NO "Made with Emergent" badge
✅ JavaScript file is 360,505 bytes (complete)
✅ Backend URL in .env points to: https://resume-deploy-fix.emergent.host/

## 🚀 AFTER UPLOAD:
Visit kylelynch.site - you should see Kyle's resume, not "Made with Emergent"!

## ❓ IF STILL HAVING ISSUES:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify all file paths are correct on DreamHost
4. Ensure static/ folder structure matches exactly
