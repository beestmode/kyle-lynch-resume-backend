# Railway Deployment Steps - Kyle Lynch Resume Backend

## Current Status
✅ Local fixes completed and tested
✅ Backend returns healthy response locally 
✅ All critical files are properly configured
✅ Fixed Railway startup timeout issue - made database initialization optional

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Verify Railway Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your Railway project dashboard:

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `MONGO_URL` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `DB_NAME` - resume_db  
- `SECRET_KEY` - Your JWT secret key for authentication
- `PORT` - Will be automatically set by Railway (should be 8000)

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to the backend service
3. Trigger a new deployment (Railway should auto-detect the Procfile)
4. Monitor deployment logs for any errors

### Step 3: Test Deployment
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `GET https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/` - Health check
- `GET https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/resume` - Resume data

### Step 4: Update Frontend Configuration
If deployment succeeds, update frontend to use the new Railway URL.

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure Procfile is in the root of backend directory
4. Check that requirements.txt includes all dependencies

## Key Files Fixed
- `/app/backend/Procfile` - Railway startup command
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Dynamic port handling  
- `/app/backend/database.py` - MongoDB SSL connection
- `/app/backend/.env` - Local variables commented out

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment
1. Test frontend integration with live Railway URL
2. Build React frontend for production
3. Upload to DreamHost
4. Configure domain mapping for kylelynch.site
